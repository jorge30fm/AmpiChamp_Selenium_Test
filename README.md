## Description
This project is an automation test for the form I-129F for AmpiChap, a legal tech company that automates legal documents. With this code we can test the different ways users can fill out the application to make sure all parts are working currectly. The test works by reading a csv file containing information about each element on the form and automating the steps to filling it out. Once finished, a log file is created and a screenshot folder is saved to the directory.

## Installation
Download the code and install all dependencies

## Usage
Navigate to root folder in terminaland run pytest. Tests will run automatically and a log file will be generated.
